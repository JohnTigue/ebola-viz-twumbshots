# ebola-viz-twumbshots

Twitter card friendly thumbnails of ebola visualizations from around the Web. These are useful for blogging about ebola vizualizations or maintaining a [Gallery of Ebola Visualizations Found Across the Web](https://github.com/JohnTigue/EbolaMapper/wiki/Gallery-of-Ebola-Visualizations-Found-Across-the-Web).

These images are intended to work well in [Twitter cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview). I needed a name for `images intended for inclusion in Twitter cards` but did not find one so `twumbshots` it is.

## Etymology
There seems to be no real definitional distinction between [thumbnails v. thumbshots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Thumbshot#How_is_.22thumbnail.22_different.3F). `Thumbnails` are etymologically rooted in images literally the size of a human thumbnail. `Thumbshots` imply screenshots which is a more technical term for preview. Personally, of the two? `thumbshots`. Really, I don't like either but they are both `thumbthings`. 

These `thumbthings` are intented to be used in the context of Twitter feeds and the subsequent blog posts that Twitter will link through to, so these are `Twitthings` and well as `thumbthings`. `Twitter + thumbs = twumbs`. So, `twumbshots` it is, which is pretty rare on the Web [(31 hits on 2014-11-22 as I write this)](https://www.google.com/search?q=twumbshots&oq=twumbshots#q=twumbshots). The domain is available if you are into that sort of thing.
